## Custom Kindle Case

Together with the software side of the project, I also decided to make a simple 3d model of a custom case for the kindle, this is specifially deisgned for the Kindle 10, but can be adapted for other devices using a 3d modeling software like Fusion or Solidwork.

### Instructions

- "Disassembly" the kindle, removing the plastic case, see [here](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Kindle_10)
- Print all three parts of the model
- Place the kindle board between the top and bottom section of the case, and glue the two together
- Glue the stand on the bottom of the case
